# Getting Started

This guide walks you through installing KyberBot, running the onboard wizard, and having your first conversation with your personal AI agent.

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing KyberBot, make sure you have:

### Required

- **Node.js 18+** -- [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Docker** -- Required for ChromaDB (the vector database). [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Claude Code subscription** -- KyberBot runs on top of Claude Code. You need an active subscription. [Get Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

### Optional

- **Telegram account** -- If you want to message your agent via Telegram
- **WhatsApp** -- If you want to message your agent via WhatsApp

### Verify Prerequisites

```bash
node --version    # Should be 18.0.0 or higher
docker --version  # Should show Docker version
claude --version  # Should show Claude Code version
```

---

## Installation

### 1. Install KyberBot

This installs the `kyberbot` command on your machine. You only do this once.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KybernesisAI/kyberbot.git
cd kyberbot
npm install
npm run build
cd packages/cli && npm link && cd ../..
```

Think of this like installing an app. The `kyberbot/` folder is the app itself -- you don't work inside it.

After this, the `kyberbot` command works from anywhere on your system.

### 2. Create Your Agent

Create a new folder anywhere on your machine and run `kyberbot onboard` inside it:

```bash
mkdir ~/my-agent
cd ~/my-agent
kyberbot onboard
```

**This folder is your agent.** Everything it knows, everything it learns, its entire personality and memory -- all lives here. You can create multiple agents in different folders if you want, each with its own name and personality, all powered by the same KyberBot install.

The onboard wizard asks you a few questions and sets up everything:

- `identity.yaml` -- Agent name, timezone, settings
- `SOUL.md` -- Agent personality (how it communicates)
- `USER.md` -- What the agent knows about you
- `HEARTBEAT.md` -- Recurring tasks it should run on a schedule
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` -- Claude Code instructions (auto-generated)
- `.env` -- API keys and secrets
- `brain/` -- Long-term knowledge files
- `skills/` -- Agent capabilities
- `data/` -- Memory databases (created on first use)

The onboard wizard walks you through 7 steps:

#### Step 1: Agent Name

Choose a name for your agent. This is how it will refer to itself in conversation.

```
What would you like to name your agent?
> Atlas
```

#### Step 2: Personality

Describe how your agent should communicate. Formal? Casual? Warm? Terse? The wizard writes this to `SOUL.md`.

```
Describe your agent's personality:
> Direct and concise. Warm but not chatty. Proactive about
> suggesting next steps. Prefers bullet points over paragraphs.
```

#### Step 3: About You

Tell your agent about yourself. Name, work, interests, goals. This populates `USER.md`.

```
Tell your agent about yourself:
> I'm a software engineer working on fintech products.
> I track my health with an Oura ring and run 3x/week.
> I'm trying to launch a SaaS product by Q3.
```

#### Step 4: Heartbeat Tasks

Configure recurring tasks. The wizard provides sensible defaults that you can customize.

```
Default heartbeat tasks:
  [x] Morning briefing (daily, 8:00 AM)
  [x] Evening review (daily, 9:00 PM)
  [ ] Weekly planning (Monday, 9:00 AM)
  [ ] Health check-in (daily, 7:00 AM)

Customize? (y/n)
```

#### Step 5: Messaging Channels (Optional)

Connect Telegram and/or WhatsApp. You can skip this and set it up later.

```
Set up Telegram? (y/n)
Set up WhatsApp? (y/n)
```

#### Step 6: Kybernesis Cloud (Optional)

Optionally connect to Kybernesis for cloud backup and cross-device sync.

```
Connect to Kybernesis cloud? (y/n)
```

After completing onboarding, you will see:

```
 ✓ Agent "Atlas" created successfully.
 ✓ SOUL.md written
 ✓ USER.md written
 ✓ HEARTBEAT.md written
 ✓ identity.yaml configured

 Run 'kyberbot' to start services, then 'claude' to chat.
```

## Starting Services

```bash
kyberbot
```

This starts the KyberBot runtime:

1. **ChromaDB** -- Starts the Docker container for vector search
2. **Server** -- Express REST API for brain endpoints
3. **Heartbeat Scheduler** -- Watches `HEARTBEAT.md` for recurring tasks
4. **Sleep Agent** -- Begins background memory maintenance
5. **Channels** -- Starts any configured messaging bridges (Telegram, WhatsApp)

You will see a splash screen showing your agent's name and the status of each service.

---

## Your First Conversation

With services running, open a **new terminal**, go to your agent's folder, and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd ~/my-agent
claude
```

Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md`, which instructs it to behave as your KyberBot agent. Try these:

```
> Hey Atlas, what do you know about me?

> Remember that my product launch deadline is June 15th.

> What's on my schedule today?

> Create a skill for tracking my running mileage.
```

The agent will:

- Read `USER.md` to recall what it knows about you
- Store new information to the brain (ChromaDB + entity graph)
- Execute heartbeat tasks on schedule
- Generate new skills when it encounters unfamiliar tasks
